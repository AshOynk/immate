1. **Open the app** → You see “Enter your resident ID” with **RES-ASH** already filled in.
2. **Tap “Open my dashboard”** → Dashboard loads with your tasks (kitchen, bathroom, room).
3. **Say:** “Residents get tasks like ‘Send proof the kitchen is clean.’ They tap **Submit proof**, record a short video in the app, and submit. Management sees it in **Review**.”
4. **Tap “Submit proof”** on any task → Pick the task, enter RES-ASH, tap Record, stop, Submit. (You can skip recording and just show the flow.)
5. **Tap “Review” in the header** → “Management sees all submissions here and marks Pass/Fail. Pass gives the resident stars; they can redeem for vouchers.”
6. **Tap “Request”** → “Management can send a task to a specific resident — like a push. They pick the resident and the task; it appears on that resident’s dashboard.”

**If tasks don’t show:** Backend (Railway or local) must be running and connected to MongoDB. Seeded tasks appear when the DB is empty.

**One-liner:** “iMmate lets residents complete tasks with video proof, earn stars, and redeem vouchers; management reviews proof and can send requests to residents.”
